Back in September I was part of a panel discussion on future directions in Intelligent Sound Engineering. This was part of the 2nd AES Workshop on Intelligent Music Production, at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London.

Despite the shaky start (macOS hot corners!) it was an interesting and entertaining event. Thanks to all involved for hosting the event and inviting me to participate.
