I started work on the Impulse core in 2015. The broadcast industry was moving towards audio over IP, immersive and object-based audio, virtualisation, and remote production. It was clear that Calrec needed a powerful and flexible new platform to support the workflows and requirements that were likely to come along with these new technologies.

When I left Calrec in 2017, I left the team with detailed concepts, designs, and specifications for the new core. The new core was launched one year later in 2018. I left before the final hardware was developed, and did not see the final product through to launch. I had no involvement in the industrial design or CMF, and the core and its integration into the product range continued to evolve before launch.

The headline call-outs from the press release at launch were:

- The flexibility and efficiency of running up to four independent consoles on a single core
- Native AoIP connectivity (AES67 and SMPTE 2110) up to 10Gbps, with massive internal routing capabilities
- A third generation FPGA processing platform (Bluefin 3) with scalable and flexible capabilities, providing fully immersive signal path with channels, buses, processing, meters, and monitoring for immersive formats up to 7.1.4
- Full redundancy including physical separation of backup hardware, allowing for geographical redundancy
