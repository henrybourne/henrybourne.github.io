Calrec's Impulse core is the realisation of a lot of thought, collaboration, and hard work from myself and Calrec’s wonderfully talented R&D team. There were a lot of people involved, but I particularly wanted to highlight contributions from [Patrick Warrington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-warrington-a380302/) (Ex. Technical Director), [Richard Whiteley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-whiteley-54120033/) (R&D Manager), [Tim Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-watson-21a23458/), [Ian Chantler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-chantler-ba904a23/), and Phil Hanson (Software), [James Rudee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-rudee-62a37729/), [Dave Wooff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wooff-79936056/), and [Andy King](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-king-27640b49/) (Hardware and Firmware), [Neil Pritchard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-pritchard-89734280) and [Matt Dutton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-dutton-a0854721/) (Mechanical and Industrial Design), and [Carla Castillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carla-castillo-32751176/) (UI and UX). They’ve all done a fantastic job in turning the very challenging, and seemingly impossible at times, product vision into reality.

I started on the research and concept for the Impulse core started about two or three years before I left Calrec in 2017. The broadcast industry was moving towards audio over IP, immersive and object-based audio, virtualisation, and remote production. It was clear that Calrec needed a powerful and flexible new platform to support the workflows and requirements that were likely to come along with these new technologies, and which would see Calrec’s customers through the next 5-10 years.

The headline callouts at launch were:

- The flexibility and efficiency of running up to four independent consoles on a single core
- Native AoIP connectivity (AES67 and SMPTE 2110) up to 10Gbps, with massive internal routing capabilities
- A third generation FPGA processing platform (Bluefin 3) with scalable and flexible capabilities, providing fully immersive signal path with channels, buses, processing, meters, and monitoring for immersive formats up to 7.1.4
- Full redundancy including physical separation of backup hardware, allowing for geographical redundancy
