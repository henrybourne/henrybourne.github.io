Launched in 2013, I was responsible for the concept, feature set, initial UI design, and user experience.

Summa builds on the solid technical foundation of previous products—[Apollo](/calrec-apollo) and [Artemis](/calrec-artemis)—and innovates with a more intuitive and simple user interface that focusses on the user rather than the technology. Summa was the catalyst that drove change through the organisation to become more user focussed. The innovations in Summa set a strong foundation for future products to be developed very efficiently, such as the follow-up console, Brio.
