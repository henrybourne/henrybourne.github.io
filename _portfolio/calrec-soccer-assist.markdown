I conceived Soccer Assist during my MSc in DSP. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for mixing on-pitch audio at sporting events, allowing users to interact directly with a visual representation of the venue rather than a row of faders.

Calrec's Assist apps defined a new category of assistive mixing tools in the broadcast audio space, and competitors were soon to follow. I was responsible for the concept, UI design, processing algorithm, and some development updates.
