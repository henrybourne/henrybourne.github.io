What's the Frequency? will help you to become a better audio engineer. It helps you to recognise the frequencies you are hearing.

Given short audio samples of pure tones or filtered noise you have to respond with the correct frequency of the tone, or the center frequency of the filtered noise. See how many you can get right in one go.

Start out easy, with octave spacing. When you feel more confident, move up to 1/3 octave spacing for a more challenging game.

Use What's the Frequency? for just a few minutes each day and you will notice an improvement in your ability to identify and label the frequencies in the sounds you hear. You'll become more efficient with an EQ. Your mixes are likely to improve. Most of all, you'll win the respect and admiration of fellow audio nerds.
