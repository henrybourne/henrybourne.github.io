Launched on 16th November 2021, diamond is a modular, IP native radio mixing console. It's also the first radio product to be designed using LUX, the Lawo Unified Experience, which is the design system I'm introducing across the Lawo portfolio.

Each diamond console is delivered with a 'standard configuration' that provides clear and intuitive workflows that will suit the most common applications. As expected from a Lawo console, this standard configuration can be extended, customised, or replaced completely with your own interface and workflow designs using [VisTool](https://lawo.com/products/vistool/), and the configuration and logic of the processing engine, the [Power Core](https://lawo.com/products/power-core/), can be tailored using On-Air Designer.
