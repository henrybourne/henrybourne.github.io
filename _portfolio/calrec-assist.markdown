I started work on Calrec Assist sometime in 2015. Assist had a few goals—an HTML based remote control UI for Apollo, Artemis, and Summa; a laptop-based UI to allow offline console configuration; to provide a UI for the then unreleased RP-1 remote production engine; and to provide a web-based UI for future projects.

I led the initial workflow design, and modularised component approach that supported the initial versions of Calrec Assist. The brilliant [Carla Castillo](https://www.behance.net/carlacastillo) led the visual design.

With the careful forethought that the team and I put in, Calrec Assist became the basis for Calrec’s next generation of products. For example, it’s the main UI for Type-R and Argo.
