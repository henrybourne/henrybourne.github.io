During my last few years at Calrec, I was tasked with leading design and development of the next generation of large format audio mixers. When I moved on, I left the company with detailed designs, specifications, and concepts, for them to execute. 

The new surface was launched in 2022, following closely my original designs.

Much respect as always to the talented R&D team, in executing and delivering this concept to the world.
