After writing the manual and providing all training when Apollo was launched in 2009, I joined the Product Management team at Calrec and led development of many new features and workflow improvements through the productâ€™s lifecycle, including a much more efficient and usable control surface layout, automixers, a source and destination protection system, autofaders, virtual GPIO (via various control protocols), snapshot sequencing, the H2O network management tool, Hydra patchbays, Loudness metering, lookahead limiters, and much more.
