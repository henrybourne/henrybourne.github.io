HOME is Lawo's management platform for IP-based media infrastructures.

I joined Lawo when HOME was just beginning, and was in the fortunate position to be able to develop the HOME interface and workflows at the same time as developing LUX, the Lawo Unified Experience, Lawo's new design system.

HOME prioritises simplicity of operation, and clarity of information, to make it simple to set up and manage your IP media infrastructure.
