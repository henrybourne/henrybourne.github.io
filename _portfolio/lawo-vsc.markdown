Lawo VSC is a virtual audio device that transforms your Mac into a powerful AES67/Ravenna client. This was a fun opportunity to design a native macOS app, with a focus on keeping the information architecture and workflow as simple as possible. 

The app icon is a fun play on the Ethernet icon, adapted to reference a sound wave.
