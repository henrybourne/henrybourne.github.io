The launch of the mc²36 MKII and phase 2 of the UHD Core development marks a significant step in Lawo’s audio production product line. I won’t go into detail here, but here are the links for the [mc²36](https://lawo.com/mc²36/) and the [A__UHD Core](https://lawo.com/a__uhd-core/) if you want to learn more.

Because of the significant improvements in product, performance, physical space, and power, we wanted to refresh the look and experience of using the mc² series products.

There are many constraints with this type of UI update to established and popular products. It requires careful balance to respect the functionality, workflows, and familiarity of the existing mc² UI for Lawo’s current customers, but to bring the appearance and workflows up to date with people’s expectations of a product in 2020.

There's much more to come, but this visual refresh is an early indicator of where we're going.
