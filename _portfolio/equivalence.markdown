Equivalence is an incredibly simple app to convert between units relevant to audio. Go between time, samples, frames, frequency, and wavelength. It's got all the stuff you need, and none of the stuff you don't. Just a clean, simple presentation of information.

Unfortunately, I no longer have time to maintain this app, and so it is no longer available for download.
