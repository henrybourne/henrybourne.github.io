I was the Product Manager for the Bowers & Wilkins Formation Flexâ€”a beautiful wireless speaker that lets you fit legendary Bowers & Wilkins sound into any space. An important product in the Formation line up, Flex can be used as a compact standalone speaker, a detailed stereo pair, or rear speakers in a surround setup when combined with a Formation Bar and Bass. A global collaboration between teams in the UK, USA, and China, I led the product execution and go-to-market activities.
