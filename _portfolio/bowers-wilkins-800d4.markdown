The biggest project I lead at Bowers & Wilkins was the 800 Series D4, the successor to the incredibly successful and awesome sounding 800 Series D3.

Alongside the Director of Product Strategy, I worked on the market study, product concept, and business case.

Working with the brilliant team of researchers and engineers, I helped to define and select the new technologies that would provide the step change in audio performance that this updated flagship speaker range deserved. I was privileged to be able to listen to some of the new technologies as the research and development were finalised, and hear step-by-step the individual sonic improvements as they made their way into the speakers.

I worked with the incredible industrial designers at [Goodwin & Hartshorn](https://goodwin-hartshorn.co.uk) and Bowers & Wilkins' production engineering team to help update the design of the range and create the beautiful new finish options.

I left Bowers & Wilkins in November 2019, as the products were part way through the production engineering phase. 800 Series D4 launched in August 2021.
