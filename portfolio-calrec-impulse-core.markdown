The Impulse core is the realisation of a lot of thought, collaboration, and hard work from myself and Calrec’s wonderfully talented R&D team. There were a lot of people involved, but I particularly wanted to highlight contributions from Patrick Warrington (Ex. Technical Director), Richard Whiteley (R&D Manager), Tim Watson, Ian Chantler, and Phil Hanson (Software), James Rudee, Dave Wooff, and Andy King (Hardware and Firmware), Neil Pritchard and Matt Dutton (Mechanical and Industrial Design), and Carla Castillo (UI and UX). They’ve all done a fantastic job in turning the very challenging, and seemingly impossible at times, product vision into reality.

I started on the research and concept for the Impulse core started about two or three years before I left Calrec. The broadcast industry was moving towards audio over IP, immersive and object-based audio, virtualisation, and remote production. It was clear that Calrec needed a powerful and flexible new platform to support the workflows and requirements that were likely to come along with these new technologies, and which would see Calrec’s customers through the next 5-10 years.

The headline callouts at launch are:

- The flexibility and efficiency of running up to four independent consoles on a single core
- Native AoIP connectivity (AES67 and SMPTE 2110) up to 10Gbps, with massive internal routing capabilities
- A third generation FPGA processing platform—Blu3fin (or Bluefin 3)—with scalable and flexible capabilities, providing fully immersive signal path with channels, buses, processing, meters, and monitoring for immersive formats up to 7.1.4
- Full redundancy including physical separation of backup hardware, allowing for geographical redundancy
