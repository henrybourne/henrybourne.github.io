The new core offers many benefits over its predecessor, including improved green credentials; not only does it feature processors tuned for efficiency, it now operates with five percent lower power consumption and fewer fans, which are now more easily accessible for maintenance.

The new fans also have automatic speed control and ambient temperature-sensing, which enable them to run 8dB quieter at 25° Celsius, while the fans operate at lower, less noticeable frequencies.

The new rack’s design features clearer status LEDs and labelling, while the control processor LAN sockets are independently configurable via the user interface to provide simpler configuration of third-party controllers, such as Calrec’s Assist.
