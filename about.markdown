## Bowers & Wilkins
### Senior Product Manager – Performance Audio

As Senior Product Manager for Performance Audio, my main responsibilities were to maintain Bowers & Wilkins’ existing performance loudspeaker range (Nautilus, 800, 700, and 600 series), and to create the next generation of high performance passive and active products. The first new product I launched was the Formation Flex—a beautiful wireless speaker that lets you fit legendary Bowers & Wilkins sound into any space. An important product in the Formation line up, Flex can be used as a compact standalone speaker, a detailed stereo pair, or rear speakers in a surround setup when combined with a Formation Bar and Bass. A global collaboration between teams in the UK, USA, and China, I led the product execution and go-to-market activities.

## Sky
### Product Manager

I led an agile scrum team of designers, analysts, developers, and testers, working on the My Sky app for iOS and Android. The app is consistently in the top 10 in free utilities category and serves over one million monthly active users. My team exceeded our KPIs to improve goal achievement and reduce digital leakage while also dedicating time for experimental innovation projects involving VR, AR, image recognition, conversational interfaces, and machine learning. The products of these experiments were tested with users, and successful projects may be developed further and taken to market.

## LIPA
### Visiting Professional

I was a Visiting Professional for 12 years. I led a module on programming and audio processing for final year graduate students, comprising a basic introduction to C++, with the final assessment being the creation of a real-time audio unit plugin using JUCE. Most students had never written a single line of code prior to this module. The module ran for ten sessions, each three hours long. The high quality of output from this intensive period demonstrates my ability to effectively communicate, motivate, and teach.

# Education

## Queen Mary University of London
### MSc, Digital Music Processing, Distinction

Attended through distance learning, in my own time. My aim was to become knowledgeable in digital signal processing techniques, not to become a DSP engineer, but to be better able to understand DSP products and more clearly communicate with engineers.

## The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts
### BA, Sound Technology, First Class

Received the Sennheiser Student Achievement Award for excellence in Multimedia Design work
